## 🧩 Game Challenges

- 🚪 **Locked Doors**:  
  - Need the Crowbar to pry open the way from Car 2 to Car 3.
  - Need the Key to open the Exit Door and escape.

- ⏰ **Timer**:  
  - 5-minute countdown from when the game begins.
  - Time bonuses possible through lucky random events.

- 👻 **Random Events**:  
  - Sometimes hear creepy noises.
  - Sometimes find helpful bonuses (+15s or +30s extra time).

- 🎭 **Fake Items**:  
  - Useless items (Old Gum, Water Bottle) clutter the train.
  - Picking them up wastes time or offers no help.

## ✨ Notes

- Exits are reversible **unless locked** (you can go forward/backward unless a locked challenge blocks you).
- Inventory can hold multiple items — be strategic about what you carry!
- You can win by reaching the Exit Door with the Key before time runs out.

## 🏆 Winning

- Escape the subway train by using the Crowbar and Key wisely.
- If time runs out, the train starts moving again with you still trapped inside...
